    <h1>Project Proposal</h1>

    <h2>What is your topic and who is the target audience?</h2>
    <p>
        My topic is free access to information on the internet. Recently online I have seen a lot of concerns around who has access to what content freely with recent developments like the TikTok ban and Meta's setting the automatically hides political content on your timeline. Both of these initiatives are based around the goal of protecting users, particularly children, from potentially  distressing content. The issue with this approach is that it ends up censoring important media for all users and calls into question what information is considered "inappropriate". A recent example that I saw of this was when Instagram users were getting less views on stories they would post about issues that were important to them because Facebooks opinion on these issues is built into the algorithm. The other issue that arises when considering a cite centered around the idea that users can post what they want, is the issue of misinformation. I think the solution to this is a social media cite that lets users post what they want along with a section for adding the sources for where they found this information so that way it can be validated.

    <h2>Do you plan to work with a partner? If so, who?</h2>
    <p>N/A</p>
    
    <h2>Identify lenses we have discussed in class that your topic may rely on most</h2>
    <p>I think the lens that my project focuses on the most is challenging the mental model of the  current goals for the internet. The current model prioritizes keeping users hooked on scrolling and selling products to users so that the companies putting the ads out can make a profit, but in the Utopian speculation, the goal will be the sharing of information so that the internet returns to being a tool for bettering society. The demographic for this project is mostly young people who have a tendency to get their news from social media rather than other news sources as this generation has a tendency to find these sources easier to access and more reliable. The goal is to create a place where they freely have access to information on the issues they are looking for with the ability to fact check the information they are finding.</p>
        
    
    <h2>What are some of the features you imagine your project/product would include?</h2>
    <p>Features I would want to include would be the ability for users to upload media, comment on other posts, and a feature where users can link the sources they are using for their posts so that other can check the information. </p>
    
    <h2>Are there possible tangents, challenges, concerns, or vague ideas related to your ideas? (It could go this direction... I am not sure about X, and I don't know how I might deal with Y).</h2>
    <p>I think the project could go in the direction of creating  a utopian future where corporate interests are not the driving force behind online interaction that allows us to get back to the original goals for the internet as outlined by Tim Bernes-Lee of collaboration, creativity, and compassion. One issue I'm running into is the creating the website aspect, as most of it would be centered around user contributions, and that might be somewhat hard to code/ implement without having users on the website.</p>
